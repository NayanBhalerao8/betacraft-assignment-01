# Overview

It includes a user-friendly interface for adding, viewing, and updating tasks associated with projects. The application uses Google OAuth for authentication and integrates with Tailwind CSS for styling.

# Features
- Project Management: Create and manage projects.
- Task Management: Create, update, and delete tasks associated with a project.
- Invite Users: Invite other users to the project.
- User Authentication: Use Google OAuth to log in to the app.
- Task Comments: Add comments to tasks to collaborate with team members.

# Future Improvements
If given more time, I would focus on enhancing the following aspects:

- Testing: Write comprehensive test cases to ensure reliability and maintainability.
- Notifications: Implement real-time notifications for project updates and task changes.
- User Roles and Permissions: Add role-based access control to manage user permissions more effectively.
- Advanced Analytics: Include analytics for tracking project progress and productivity metrics.
- Enhanced UI/UX: Refine the user interface for a more intuitive experience and better mobile responsiveness.
- Email Notifications: Add email notifications for task assignments, comments, and project invitations.
